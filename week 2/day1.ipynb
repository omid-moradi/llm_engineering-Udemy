    "## Using Hugging Face Hosted Models\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will run the `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct` model directly on Google Colab.  \n",
    "Instead of using external APIs like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google, we will use Hugging Face's model hub.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up your Hugging Face Access\n",
    "\n",
    "Before proceeding, make sure you have a Hugging Face account and an access token.  \n",
    "You can create a token [here](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) if you don't have one yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have your token, we'll use it to authenticate with Hugging Face to download the model files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:**  \n",
    "- Running large models on Colab can use significant memory. It's best to make sure you are connected to a GPU instance (`Runtime > Change runtime type > GPU`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hugging Face Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "We will log in to Hugging Face using the `notebook_login()` method inside the notebook, so no need for a separate `.env` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't need to worry about multiple API keys — just Hugging Face token is enough!\n"

       "\n",
       "### 1. **Complexity**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   Is the task complex and requires deep understanding or domain-specific knowledge?\n",
       "*   Can it be broken down into smaller sub-problems?\n",
       "\n",
       "### 2. **Data Availability and Quality**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   Does the dataset have sufficient size, diversity, and quality to train on effectively?\n",
       "*   Are there any missing data points or noisy information that could affect model performance?\n",
       "\n",
       "### 3. **Speed and Scalability**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   Will the model need to process large amounts of data quickly and efficiently?\n",
       "*   Can the system handle high traffic volumes without significant latency or resource consumption?\n",
       "\n",
       "### 4. **Specific Goals and Requirements**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   What specific objectives does the project aim to achieve with the LLM solution?\n",
       "*   Are there any particular constraints or limitations on training time, memory usage, or computational resources required?\n",
       "\n",
       "### 5. **Domain Expertise and Domain-Specific Knowledge**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   How much expertise and specialized knowledge about the target industry or topic exists within your organization?\n",
       "*   Do you possess this expertise directly or can you assemble relevant external experts for guidance?\n",
       "\n",
       "### 6. **Cost and Resource Considerations**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   What budget is allocated for developing, maintaining, and deploying the LLM solution?\n",
       "*   Are there available personnel and infrastructure requirements for building and managing the application?\n",
       "\n",
       "### 7. **Integration with Existing Systems and Processes**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   How well will the new LLM integration fit with existing workflows, processes, and tools?\n",
       "*   Any potential technical debt from integrating multiple systems might impact overall development complexity.\n",
       "\n",
       "If these questions are answered \"yes\" to most of them, then it's likely suitable to utilize an LLM solution for addressing those problems. However, carefully evaluate each case individually as no one-size-fits-all approach applies.\n",
       " \n",
       "Remember, having realistic expectations regarding both the benefits and challenges associated with using LLMs means being prepared to adapt solutions as needed based upon feedback during implementation and testing phases."
